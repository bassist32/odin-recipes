        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This effortless hash is perfect for breakfast or brunch</p>
        <p>A simple, delicious meal for two using just six ingredients!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients (Serves 2)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 potatoes, cut into 2cm cubes (about 450g)</li>
            <li>3 rashers back bacon</li>
            <li>1 red pepper, cut into 2cm cubes</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>50g feta, crumbled (optional)</li>
            <li>small handful of parsley, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tip the potatoes into a pan of cold water with a generoud pinch of salt. Bring to the boil, then reduce the head and simmer for 10 mins until tender. Drain well and set aside to steam-dry.</li>
            <li>Place the bacon rashers into a 30cm wide ovenproof frying pan. Fry over a medium heat for 3-4 mins on each side until almost crispy. Transfer to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan, to cool and then cut roughly into strips.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat the residual bacon fat in the pan over a medium heat. Tip in the potatoes and cook for 3-5 mins. Mix in the peppers and season well, cook for 3 mins more. Stir, then cook for a further 2-4 mins until the potatoes are lightly browned. Finally, stir in the bacon strips and cook for another 2 mins.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and make four gaps in the mixture. Crack an egg into each gap and sprinkle over the feta (if using). Bake in the oven for 6-8 mins or until the eggs are cooked. Scatter over the parsley to serve.</li>
        </ol>
